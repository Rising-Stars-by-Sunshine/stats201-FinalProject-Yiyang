Infant mortality and life expectancy in China,"Background

It is reported that the infant mortality (IM) rate decreased rapidly in China and the life expectancy (LE) also had a high increase. Our objective was to determine the health status of the Chinese population by investigating IM and LE and their inter-relationship.

Material/Methods

Based on a literature review on the history and current status of IM and LE in China and other major countries, the relationship between IM, LE, and per capita gross national income (GNI) was investigated in 2013.

Results

The decline in IM from 30% to 15% took China only 7 years, which was faster than in developed countries. The leading causes of infant death in China were perinatal diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, congenital anomalies, accidents, and signs, symptoms, and ill-defined conditions. Most under-5 mortality occurred during infancy (80%), particularly during the neonatal period (55%). LE was negatively correlated with IM (r=−0.921, P<0.001) and per capita GNI (r=0.778, P<0.001), while IM was negatively correlated with per capita GNI (r=−0.735, P<0.001). However, healthcare capabilities and per capita GNI in China are still below the level of developing countries. Some countries have a comparable IM and healthcare capabilities, but they have a much higher per capita GNI than China.

Conclusions

In China, IM has decreased and IE increased rapidly. However, they were not in parallel with the current economic development. Deviation of these data might be attributed to many factors. In-house surveys and hospital-based follow-ups should be carried out to better understand infant death."
The demographic responses to famine: The case of China 1958–61,"re-1949 China was ‘The Sick Man of Asia’, ‘The Land of Famine’. In 1949 Mao brought the communists to power and in the re-ordered world, all such problems were supposedly overcome — but not so. Thirty years ago China suffered one of the world's worst famines. Over the four years 1958–61, China suffered some 25–30 million more deaths and experienced some 30–35 million fewer births than might have been expected under normal conditions. Yet for almost a quarter of a century there would be few, outside of China, who were aware of the existence let alone the dimensions of the disaster. Access to Chinese census data since the mid-1980s has permitted a preliminary analysis of the demographic impact of the famine."
"The Growth of China's Population, 1949-1982 (With Special Reference to the Demographic Disaster of 1960-61)","ABSTRACT
Some of China's recently released demographic data are presented and analysed. Comparisons are drawn to show that China's current growth rate of population, her levels of mortality, fertility and life expectancy are all well above the norm for a country at her level of economic development. The product of some 680 million births and 225 million deaths has given China an average growth rate of just under 2 per cent per year over the period 1949-81. However, the growth rate has varied dramatically over the past 30 years. Fragments of evidence suggest that in the years of economic disaster (1960-61), soaring death rates exceeded the plummeting birth rates and China's population declined by several million. The substantial rise in mortality and decline in fertility appear to be a response to famine conditions, brought about by a 25 per cent decline in foodgrain production between 1957 and 1960. During the subsequent 'baby boom' (1962-65), the annual growth rate peaked to 3.35 per cent and a phase of 'explosive' growth increased China's population by 122 million in six years. However, the rapid growth was short lived and a substantial decline of fertility in the 1970s caused the rate of natural increase to fall from 25.99 per 1000 in 1970 to 11.70 in 1979. This large and rapid reduction in fertility represents a very positive response to the family planning programme which was so intensively implemented in the 1970s. Current birth control programmes are targeted to reduce the population to a perceived optimum level of around 700 million by the year 2070."
"Managing population dynamics in China, Taiwan and Iran since 1960. What are the differences? What is the societal and economic impact in these countries? What do we know about their future strategies to prosper in the 21st century?","The aim of this paper is to analyze and compare population dynamics in China, Taiwan and Iran from 1960 until today. While investigating, we uncovered that their similarities reside in the fact that their fertility rate shrunk within a few decades and was combined on average with a decreasing mortality rate. China’s one child policy, added to a change in childbearing behavior resulted in a fertility rate being divided by three within 30 years. Combined with lower mortality rate, due to Mao’s investments in health facilities, the population is ageing rapidly and the younger cohorts are too few to support the society. The other main consequence of the policy lies in the idea that having a girl was viewed unfavorably at the time and so it was likely that abortion or infanticide was practiced when the child was a girl. Consequently, nowadays the males’ cohorts are undoubtedly bigger compared to the women one’s which will result for some of them in an inability to marry. Taiwan is currently facing a similar issue regarding population aging. On the contrary to China, the fertility decrease was mostly due to social behavior changes that inherently triggered a weaker wish to build a family and have children. People tended to postpone their marriage to focus on education and singlehood became a social phenomenon. Taiwan increasing life expectancy was due to a wealthier population and country that provided a better access to facilities and education. Iran on the other side saw its life expectancy decrease as the war was raging with Iraq. War impacted in a different manner all of Iran’s population dynamics. Fertility decreased during this period and continued to thanks to the introduction of family planning and modern contraception especially in rural areas. The increasing aging population and low fertility rate pose key challenges for the society and the economy. It is now clear that each of these countries will encounter difficulties in the future when their age pyramids evolve. Government have taken into account the challenges and are working on implementing structures that will: support the elderly, boost childbirth and provide workforce in the years to come. Migration, also, was and still is key in defining these countries’ demographics. These last decades, various flows of population as much inward as outward occurred in China, Taiwan and Iran. China for instance, mostly witnessed internal migration and migration inward China after the opening of the country in 1978. Migrants were attracted by economic development and increasing wage level in the 1980s. Taiwan also had to face an economic migration after its great growth in 1960. However, due to strict control of permanent residences in the country and because Taiwan was not welcoming non-educated people prior

to 1990, migration has never been as important as in China. Iran witnessed all types of population flows but reasons were mainly political or religious more than economical. A great issue for Iran is the “brain drain” of the country on one side and a major arrival of refugees during the different wars on the other. Even though Iran is not highly concerned by refugee’s migration nowadays, “brain drain” is still an actual problem. The next decades will be undoubtedly decisive for these countries as they wish to reverse their fertility trend and retain a strong growth. Population dynamics will represent crucial indicators that will define the future of China, Taiwan and Iran."
China: population change and population control,"Since 1949 China's population has increased by 500 million and thereby grown at an average rate of 2 % per year. Annual growth rates have varied dramatically, falling from 3.3 % in 1963 to 1.2 % in 1979 and registering a population decline of 13.5 million in the famine years of 1960/61. China's demographic disaster in 1958/61 ranks as one of the most devastating in the history of the world. Chinese leaders have oscillated between pro- and anti-natalist policies. However, in the 1970s the government launched its third, its most intensive and to date its most successful family planning programme. So succesful that the total fertility rate declined from 6.4 in 1968 to 2.2 in 1980 and the level of contraceptive use in China was raised to the levels currently experienced in the Developed World. Despite the high rate of contraceptive prevalence, induced abortion is still extensively used to prevent unplanned births. The extent to which China's birth control programme has been implemented on a voluntary, coercive or compulsory basis is open to question. A rapid increase in the age of marriage and a substantial improvement in female education have made important contributions to the decline in fertility. Large differences in fertility exist between rural and urban China, reflecting significant differences in the average age of marriage and the very marked difference in educational attainment between the cities and the countryside. Whether the government directed family planning programme or socio-economic development has had the greatest impact on the decline in fertility, is under discussion. Whatever the motive force, the pace of demographic modernisation has been impressive and by international standards China now enjoys advanced levels of demographic development at an early stage of economic development."
Mortality in China 1964–2000,"This paper uses data from censuses and surveys to re-estimate mortality levels and trends in China ,from the 1960s to 2000. We use the General Growth Balance method to evaluate the completeness of death reporting above the youngest ages in three censuses of the People's Republic of China from 1982 to 2000, concluding that reporting quality is quite high, and revisit the completeness of death recording in the 1973–75 Cancer Epidemiology Survey. Estimates of child mortality from a variety of direct and indirect sources are reviewed, and best estimates arrived at. Our estimates show a spectacular improvement in life expectancy in China: from about 60 years in the period 1964–82 to nearly 70 years in the period 1990–2000, with a further improvement to over 71 years by 2000. We discuss why survival rates continue improving in China despite reduced government involvement in and increasing privatization of health services, with little insurance coverage."
