- **Project Summary**: 
  - [Summarize the Background/Motivation]The 1960 famine in China was one of the largest natural disasters in human history, resulting in widespread hunger and mortality. The famine was caused by a combination of natural disasters, such as drought and floods, and poor agricultural policies (Ashton et al. 1984). Despite the significant impacts of the famine on the population, including a decline in life expectancy, it is unclear how the natural disaster affected life expectancy in the long term.
  - [Research Questions]How does the natural disaster of 1960 affect life expectancy in China?

  - [Application Scenario (Data Source)]https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy
  - [Methodology] Linear regression analysis and causal inference.
  - [Results]According to the collected data, life expectancy in China, which had been rising steadily, did decline sharply in 1960 (Roser, Ortiz-Ospina, and Ritchie 2019). But after 1960, it showed a different change than predicted.
Contrary to expectations, life expectancy in China rose sharply after 1960 and almost kept rising at a similar rate. This sharp rise is due to the fact that people who had a significant negative impact on life expectancy in 1960 may have died and not been included in subsequent statistics when the data were compiled. This overturns previous assumptions and suggests that the 1960 natural disaster may have had a positive effect or have no significant effect on life expectancy in China. 
By comparing historical conditions, development process, environment and climate, and other factors, the health background of Hong Kong is similar to that of China (Yao and Wu 2008). But because Hong Kong is relatively isolated from mainland China, it is hardly affected by natural disasters and shows no anomalies in life expectancy statistics. After the 1960 natural disaster, the trend in life expectancy in China remained similar to that in Hong Kong, which was unaffected. This further illustrates the limited impact of the 1960 natural disaster on life expectancy in China.
  - [Intellectual Merits and Practical impacts of your project.] Although many people die of starvation during natural disasters, others who survive may have greater resilience. But there is also a suspicion that healthy people with higher life expectancy are more likely to survive famine.
Since data on health is collected on a yearly basis, the data sets are not large enough for machine learning and may lead to inaccurate final results. However, it has also inspired the creation of more frequent health data sets, which may be the direction of future research. Machine learning for health must be repeatable but machine learning in health is poor in reproducibility metrics, such as data sets and code accessibility, compared to other areas and has a long way to go (McDermott et al. 2021).
In addition, life expectancy may be influenced by other factors, such as changes in national health policies after the natural disaster and increased health awareness among people. The development of technology and medical technology may also be taken into account, and the analysis of these combined factors may be the direction of further research.
